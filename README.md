## Workflow Nodes

| Node | Description | Outputs |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Start | Starts a connected workflow | None |
| Open URL | Navigates the shared browser session to a URL | URL, title |
| Act | Performs a natural-language browser action | Success, message, URL |
| Extract | Extracts page content from a natural-language instruction | Extraction |
| Observe | Finds matching browser elements and actions | Matches, selector, description |
| Agent | Runs a multi-step autonomous browser task | Success, message, completed |
| Send Email | Sends an HTML email through Resend | Email ID |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- [Clerk](https://cwa.run/clerk) application with Organizations enabled
- PostgreSQL database, such as [Neon](https://cwa.run/neon)
- [Trigger.dev](https://cwa.run/trigger) project
- [Liveblocks](https://cwa.run/liveblocks) project
- [Browserbase](https://cwa.run/browserbase) account
- [Resend](https://resend.com/) account
- Optional [Sentry](https://cwa.run/sentry) project for error monitoring and source maps

> Read Setup Folder for more information on how to setup the project.

**OR**

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramanrishit448-RR/browser-automation-app.git
cd browser-automation-app
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in the service credentials in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

NEON_BRANCH=main
DATABASE_URL=
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=

TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY=

NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY=
LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY=

BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=
RESEND_API_KEY=

NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=
SENTRY_DSN=
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=
```

### 3. Configure Clerk

Create a Clerk application and enable Organizations. The dashboard requires an active organization, and every workflow is scoped to the current organization.

To enable paid features, configure Clerk Billing with an organization plan whose slug is exactly `pro`. Agent nodes and Browserbase session replay check this plan in both the UI and server-side actions.

### 4. Set up the database

Generate and apply the Drizzle migrations:

```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

For local prototyping, you can push the schema directly:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

`DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` is preferred for migrations. Drizzle falls back to `DATABASE_URL` when the unpooled URL is unavailable.

### 5. Configure integrations

Create projects in Trigger.dev and Liveblocks, then add their keys to `.env.local`. Add your Browserbase API key for Stagehand execution and session replay, and a Resend API key for the Send Email node.

The Stagehand model runs through Browserbase Model Gateway, so no separate model-provider API key is required.

### 6. Run Trigger.dev

Start the Trigger.dev development worker in a separate terminal:

```bash
npx trigger.dev dev
```

The worker discovers tasks under `features/` using `trigger.config.ts`.

### 7. Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), sign in, select or create an organization, and create your first workflow.

## Deploy on Railway

[Railway](https://cwa.run/railway) can build and host the Next.js application directly from this repository.

### 1. Create the service

Push the repository to GitHub, create a Railway project, and choose **Deploy from GitHub repo**. Railway Railpack detects the Node.js application and installs dependencies from `package-lock.json`.

If automatic detection needs to be overridden, use:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Start command | `npm start` |

You can also deploy the current directory with the Railway CLI:

```bash
railway login
railway init
railway up --detach -m "Initial deployment"
```

### 2. Add production variables

Copy the values from `.env.local` into the Railway service variables. Use production credentials for Clerk, Neon, Trigger.dev, Liveblocks, Browserbase, Resend, and Sentry.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

DATABASE_URL=
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=
TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY=
LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY=
BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=
RESEND_API_KEY=

NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=
SENTRY_DSN=
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=
```

`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is only required when uploading source maps during the production build.

### 3. Prepare production services

Apply the committed Drizzle migrations to the production database before serving traffic:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

Deploy the workflow task to Trigger.dev separately. Railway hosts the Next.js application, while Trigger.dev executes the durable background workflows:

```bash
npx trigger.dev deploy
```

Make sure the Railway service uses the production `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` from the same Trigger.dev project and environment.

### 4. Configure the domain

Generate a Railway domain from the service settings or connect a custom domain. Add the production domain to your Clerk application and any service allowlists that restrict application origins.

Every push to the connected branch creates a new Railway deployment. Check the build and runtime logs from the Railway dashboard if a release fails.

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[React Flow canvas] -->|sync| B[Liveblocks room]
    A -->|validate and save| C[(Neon Postgres)]
    C --> D[Trigger.dev task]
    D --> E[Stagehand]
    E --> F[Browserbase session]
    D -->|step metadata| G[Live run console]
    F -->|recording| H[Session replay]
```

1. **Design** - Liveblocks synchronizes nodes, edges, cursors, and presence on the React Flow canvas.
2. **Validate** - Running a workflow validates the graph and saves its current snapshot to Postgres.
3. **Schedule** - Trigger.dev topologically sorts connected nodes and executes them in dependency order.
4. **Automate** - Browser nodes share one Browserbase-backed Stagehand session for the entire run.
5. **Connect** - Node outputs are stored by node ID and interpolated into downstream inputs.
6. **Observe** - Trigger.dev streams step status, timing, outputs, and errors back to the console.
7. **Replay** - Completed browser runs expose their recording through a server-side replay proxy.
